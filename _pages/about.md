This repository will be used for members to start building their own app from scratch until they have a working SHPE UCF app.

This includes developing the following, across Y assignments:
* Environment
* Multiple screens
* Custom components
* Firebase
* Router
* Redux

The goal is for you to feel comfortable working with React Native, JavaScript, and the Google Firebase before you start contributing to our app. This will help you follow good coding practices, our contribution styling guidelines, and have a more hands-on approach to programming. You will get to build your own app, create your own database, and understand all React have essentials (Redux, Router, components, states/props).

If you have any questions, reach out to the current Tech Directors (right now it is Sof√≠a and Bryce)
through Slack or [tech.shpeucf@gmail.com](mailto:tech.shpeucf@gmail.com).
