What is React Native?
...

Once you have installed the necessary software to set-up your environment, you will need to install React Native (or Expo, if you were not able to install your emulator).

| React Native                      | Expo                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ``` npm i -g react-native-cli ``` | ``` npm i -g expo-cli ``` |
