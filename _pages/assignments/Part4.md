***Preamble***  
It is assumed that the reader has some basic programming knowledge and is able to web search anything that may not be explicitly written in the tutorial.

For reference, a link to the solutions can be found at the bottom of the page.
</div>

For this section, we will create three new screens: landing, registration, and login. These will be used to set up the redux in [part 5](./part-5) so that we can write or read to/from the database.

Since this means it's only about UI, I will show you the ropes of getting input from a user, but not specify how the styling should be as it will be entirely up to you.
