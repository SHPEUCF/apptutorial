We finally get to (possibly) the hardest or weirdest part of mobile design: Redux. We will start slow and get your feet wet, but you will be 10E6 feet below the sea level by the end of part 5. After this, you will be able to create an account, log in, and access the user's name or any other information so that you can use it in other screens, such as the Dashboard from [part 1](./part-1) (no more hard-coded stuff, yay!). Then, in [part 6](./part-6) we'll add some additional info., such as making your own components, some JavaScript quirks, and who knows..?
