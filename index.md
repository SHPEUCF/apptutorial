### What is this?
This is a website for the SHPE UCF Tech Committee, whose main goal is to get members working with react-native while also acting as a standalone website for other fun stuff. Check out [About](/about/) for more info.

### Who is this for?
New and old members (plus everyone in-between) in Tech Committee that want a refresh on the app.

### Do I need to finish this before starting to develop for SHPE UCF?
No.
